# CoinToss
This StreamElements custom widget visualizes a coin toss.

Special thanks to Benno.
 
## Description of operation:
The widget plays a randomly picked video from one of two video pools, when the associated command has been detected in chat.  
This approach was choosen to make a binary outcome look more dynamic.
